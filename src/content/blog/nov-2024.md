Early November might seem like a strange time to write an update post, but so much has been happening lately that I decided that now was as good a time as ever to write one.

Let's get right into what we've been creating. In no particular order:

### LlamaLoader

This started off as "just" an installer for Tomb with a GUI, but it quickly gained an entire bundle of features, including most features from LlamaToolkit, the ability to update the game engine, deobfuscate any JavaScript code, download mods directly from the repository, and more. As of right now, only Windows is supported, which means LlamaToolkit is not deprecated. You can get it [here](https://github.com/Llamaware/LlamaLoader).

### Multilanguage Mod

This was my first time creating a mod, instead of a modding tool. This mod displays sentences in two languages at once, helping you to learn your target language. You can get it [here](https://llamawa.re/mods), or install it directly via LlamaLoader. Of course, it also requires a [translation](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2378900/discussions/2/6993585599474910790/) to be installed in order to work.

### Coffin Anki

Building off of the Multilanguage Mod, I was messing around with the dialogue files when suddenly, inspiration struck. The dialogue was in a CSV format, similar to the CSV files that could be imported into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). (If you don't know what Anki is, it's basically a flashcard program that uses spaced repetition to help you memorize any deck you'd like. It's very popular for language-learning.) Why not write a program to convert the Coffin dialogue into an Anki deck? It had already been done before, with [Steins;Gate Anki](https://github.com/asakura42/steins-gate-anki). And thus, Coffin Anki was born. You can get the script [here](https://github.com/Llamaware/coffin-anki), and there is a premade Japanese-English deck if you wish to preview what the results look like.

The following "projects" were not significant enough to get their own entry on the Projects page, but they are still worth a mention.

### CoffinDiskMark

This is basically a joke program inspired by [CrystalDiskMark](https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskmark/) that benchmarks your computer by testing how quickly it can decrypt copies of Coffin consecutively. You can get it [here](https://github.com/Llamaware/CoffinDiskMark).

### FaustBot

This is a very niche Discord bot that monitors the status of SoftEther VPN servers and posts it as a persistent embed to a channel of your choice. It may be useful if you host a SoftEther server, which is used by certain games (such as Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune) to emulate LAN play. This was my first time being commissioned by a client to develop a program. You can get FaustBot [here](https://github.com/Llamaware/FaustBot).

### ReneeBot

I created a simple Discord bot to parse the dialogue file from Coffin and do things with it, such as allowing you to get random quotes and have the bot auto-reply to your quotes with the next quote in the file. You can check out ReneeBot [here](https://github.com/Llamaware/ReneeBot).

### Simple Apps

These are not really modding-related in the slightest, but when am I ever gonna get a chance to talk about these? I'm creating a collection of web apps that do exactly what they say on the tin.

- [Whiteboard](https://onehalf.dev/whiteboard/) - has some cool features, such as touch-tablet support and a pen stabilizer!
- [Timer](https://onehalf.dev/timer)
- [Webcam/Mic Test](https://onehalf.dev/webcam-test/)

### More to come?

It's too early to say for sure what's next, but there are already a couple things in the works. (One of them being a behemoth of a project, so absurd that I'm unsure if it will become reality...)

As always - coming eventually(TM), maybe.

Whew, that was a lot to get through. That's all for now! I might write more update posts, about one per month, if significant developments occur.
