This is an informational post for those who are wondering what happened to the **TCOAAL Modding** Discord server.

Unfortunately, the server owner, who is no longer affiliated with Llamaware, decided to delete the entire server with no prior warning.

Basil and I (OneHalf) were admins on the server, but we regretfully did not have any say in this decision. We also do not know the reason(s) for the deletion, as the server owner declined to comment on it.

While this is a setback for the Coffin modding community, the Llamaware website and our software will continue to be available online and maintained as usual. At this time, there are no plans to make a new TCOAAL Modding server.

We have also created an invite-only **Llamaware Discord server**, tailored towards modders and developers. This is a more technical space for discussion of mod creation, reverse-engineering, and game development. We encourage you to [apply for access here](https://tally.so/r/wADLQk) if you fall under this umbrella.

Until next time!
