A mod that replaces the first interaction between Andrew and Ashley with a recreation of Jazz Emu's My Brothe. You don't (and for the most part can't) have to press any keys. Also, it removes the commands that play the alarm clock ticking noise.

Yes, every time I wanted to see if the offsets matched the song, I had listen to the entire sequence from the beginning.

This took several hours to make and sync, and is intended as a joke rather than something playable, so there are some rough edges I haven't bothered to smooth out, including:
1. You are able to fast-forward the text, which will cause desync.
2. The mod is **not localizable.**
